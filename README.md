The game is a turn-based strategy game called "Water Gun Fight Game." It is played on a 10x10 grid where two players, the user and the opponent, place forts formed in Tetris shapes (T, L, or I) on the grid. Each fort occupies 5 cells and is formed of the same letter (A to E), without overlapping.
The forts are randomly distributed on the grid at the start of the game.

The objective of the game is to destroy all of the opponent's forts before they destroy yours. Players take turns firing shots at the opponent's grid by entering coordinates.
If a shot hits a cell occupied by a fort, that cell is marked as hit. The opponent's forts are randomly distributed on the grid in Tetris shapes, each shape occupying 5 cells and formed of the same letter (A to E), without overlapping.
Opponents whose forts have been destroyed stop firing shots, do not score any points, and are removed from the list of opponents, reducing the number of remaining forts.

The game ends when all of the opponent's forts are destroyed or when the opponent's team has scored 2500 points. 
Players earn points for hitting the opponent's forts, with the score being relative to the number of undamaged cells in the opponent's forts.
The game board displays all cells, revealing the location of all forts with unique uppercase letters (A to E), hit forts as lowercase letters, and undamaged cells as uppercase letters. Players can also enable cheat mode to see the opponent's forts during the game.
